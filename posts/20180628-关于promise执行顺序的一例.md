`.then/catch` handlers are pending execution until the engine is done with the current code.

```js
const executor = resolve => {
    console.log('executor running')
    resolve('done')
}
const promise = new Promise(executor)
promise.then(console.log)
console.log('code finished')
```
运行结果

```
executor running
code finished
done
```
